In this project "Urban_Population_Analysis", I read in and analyzed a csv file involving information about the variation of the urban population
in different countries in the world. Relying on important tools, functions, methods and libraries, I could plot such variation and try to link and 
understand the political, economic and/or social reasons that lead to the unusal trends for some of the variations.
